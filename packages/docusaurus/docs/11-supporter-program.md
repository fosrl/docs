# Supporter Program

## What is this?

Pangolin will always be free and open source, but maintaining the project takes a lot of time and resources. To help support ongoing development — including bug fixes, [new features](https://github.com/orgs/fosrl/projects/1/views/1), and community support — we’ve added a way for users to directly contribute. **We will not use this to paywall features.**

If you’d like to support the project, you can purchase a supporter key to remove the support button and other marks from the UI. Afterward, you will get to learn a little bit about your adopted Pangolin!

We know it’s not the most exciting feature, but it helps us keep Pangolin healthy and moving forward.

:::note

If you have already purchased a Supporter Key and wish to also purchase a Professional Edition license as a business please check your supporter portal for a 75% discount code!

There is no restrictions on sites for the open source version of Pangolin.

## How does this work?

We are using GitHub sponsors. In order to support and obtain your key:

1. Purchase EITHER the "$25 one time" or "$95 one time" tier on GitHub
2. Go to https://supporters.fossorial.io and log in with your GitHub account
3. Copy the supporter key
4. Go to your Pangolin instance and click the supporter button
5. Enter the supporter key

## How many times can I use my key?

You can use your supporter key on as many servers and installations as you would like.

## What are the tiers?

### Limited Supporter ($25)

5 or less users

Once you add your 6th user the support button and other marks will return to the application. You can remove it again by either removing a user or purchasing a full supporter key.

### Full Supporter ($95)

Unlimited users

You can add as many users as you want and the support button and other marks will never return.

## How can I upgrade?

You can upgrade by purchasing the Full Supporter ($95) tier. After you purchase this tier your account will be automatically upgraded and you can restart your Pangolin server to update the status.

Due to the way GitHub tiers work even if you have purchased the lower tier you must purchase the higher tier. We apologize for the inconvenience but thank you for the extra donation.

## Can I hide the supporter button?

You can hide the supporter button without paying by clicking the "Hide for 7 days" button at the bottom of the dialog.

## What happens if I buy a tier again?

Thanks for your generous donation!

You can only obtain a supporter key once. While GitHub allows you to donate multiple times this will not change your supporter key.

## Can I get a refund?

GitHub Sponsors DOES NOT allow us to refund donations. Please make sure that you are comfortable supporting the project before you purchase a tier.

## How is this different than the Professional Edition?

The Supporter Program is a way to support the project and remove the
support marks. It is a one time donation. No features are unlocked.

The Professional plan is a paid license that allows you to use the
software in a commercial environment that unlocks features and
provides support. It is a monthly subscription.
